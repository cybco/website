**Last Updated:** January 25, 2025

## Overview

NFC Read & Write ("the App") is developed by Cybco and is designed to read and write data to NFC cards. This privacy policy explains how we handle your information.

## Information We Collect

**We do not collect any personal information.** The App operates entirely on your device without any data collection, transmission, or storage on external servers.

### Local Data Storage

The App stores the following information locally on your device only:

- **NFC Card History**: Records of NFC cards you have read or written, including:
  - URLs written to or read from cards
  - Text content written to or read from cards
  - Date and time of operations
  - Technical details about the NFC cards (card type, serial number, capacity)

All of this data remains on your device and is never transmitted to Cybco or any third party.

## NFC Usage

The App uses your device's NFC hardware to:
- Read data from compatible NFC cards
- Write data to compatible NFC cards

NFC operations occur locally between your device and the NFC card. No data is transmitted over the internet during NFC operations.

## Data We Do NOT Collect

We do not collect, store, or transmit:
- Personal identification information
- Contact information
- Location data
- Device identifiers
- Analytics data
- Crash reports
- Usage statistics

## Third-Party Services

The App does not integrate with any third-party services or analytics platforms.

## Data Security

All data created by the App is stored locally on your device using iOS's secure storage mechanisms. You have full control over this data and can delete it at any time by:
- Clearing the app's history through the in-app interface
- Uninstalling the App from your device

## Children's Privacy

The App does not knowingly collect any information from children. The App is rated 4+ and is suitable for all ages.

## URL Handling

When you write URLs to NFC cards or read URLs from NFC cards, the App may display these URLs and provide the option to open them in your device's web browser. We do not track, log, or monitor which URLs you access.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the "Last Updated" date at the top of this document. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated privacy policy.

## Your Rights

Since we do not collect any personal information, there is no data for us to access, modify, or delete. All data remains under your control on your device.
